# Haunted-House

!Very Difficult!
Wake up in a Haunted House. 

You're tied up! Pick an option to cut the ropes loose:

rusting pipe
twist yourself free
edge of bed

Rusting Pipe: you cut yourself and you're bleeding out 
Go through the door.
Elevator: Elevator alerts bad guy.
Staircase



Twisting yourself free: Ropes still bind your hands ()
Go through the door.
Elevator: Elevator alerts bad guy.
Staircase

Edge of the bed: You are free (super smart)
Go through the door.
Elevator: Elevator alerts bad guy.
Staircase: falls thru

Staircase: If you previously chose rusting pipe, you fall thru and get injured

Eliminates choice of pulling yourself out.

Next options walk towards a door in the hole in the staircase or wrap hands with ripped up shirt and try to pull yourself out

Staircase if you chose edge of bed you can pull yourself out or go thru door in the space underneath the staircase (pretty much same options as if you chose rusted pipe)

If you chose rusted pipe and went w cloth option, you fall back down and fall down on broken wooden plank. You get impaled and suffer a slow death as you bleed out.

If you chose rusted pipe and went through the door, you find another person who has been kidnapped and you can use them as your accomplice! They are uninjured and can pull themyselves out the staircase. They also help pull you out and make it up to the first floor together. (same for if you chose edge of bed)

If you chose edge of bed and pulled yourself out of basement you miss iut on having an accomplice.

First floor:

You see the kidnapper lying on the couch taking a nap.

You can cross to the front door but the path you have to take is in front of the napping kidnapper. He wakes up and comes to get you. If you choose this option you start in the basement again.

You also see a path leading to the kitchen. If you decide to go here, you get the option of choosing your weapon.

butter knife
frozen block of meat
no weapon

Butter knife: Useless you go back to attack the kidnapper but only leave him with a few scratches.

Options after:

sacrifice your accomplice
sacrifice yourself

if you sacrifice your accomplice you can make it to the second floor and get out onto the porch

if you sacrifice yourself you start off in the basement

Block of meat: You use it to knock the kidnapper unconscious for a short period of time. (kidnapper will later wake up once you pick the option to either go up lr go thru the front and will then give options to sacrifice your accomplice or yourself like prev choices)

Options after: 

go to second floor
try and go through the front door

None (best choice): You decided to look around the house and can go through

Backdoor
Second Floor

Backdoor: you find out its locked and wake up the kidnapper

Second Floor: you go upstairs and to kidnappers bedroom to find a fire escape in front of a locked window
