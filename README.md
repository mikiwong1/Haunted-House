# Haunted-House

!Very Difficult!
Wake up in a Haunted House. 

You're tied up! Pick an option to cut the ropes loose:

rusting pipe
twist yourself free
edge of bed

Rusting Pipe: you cut yourself and you're bleeding out 
Go through the door.
Elevator: Elevator alerts bad guy.
Staircase



Twisting yourself free: Ropes still bind your hands ()
Go through the door.
Elevator: Elevator alerts bad guy.
Staircase

Edge of the bed: You are free (super smart)
Go through the door.
Elevator: Elevator alerts bad guy.
Staircase: falls thru

Staircase: If you previously chose rusting pipe, you fall thru and get injured

Eliminates choice of pulling yourself out.

Next options walk towards a door in the hole in the staircase or wrap hands with ripped up shirt and try to pull yourself out

Staircase if you chose edge of bed you can pull yourself out or go thru door in the space underneath the staircase (pretty much same options as if you chose rusted pipe)

If you chose rusted pipe and went w cloth option, you fall back down and fall down on broken wooden plank. You get impaled and suffer a slow death as you bleed out.

If you chose rusted pipe and went through the door, you find another person who has been kidnapped and you can use them as your accomplice! They are uninjured and can pull themyselves out the staircase. They also help pull you out and make it up to the first floor together. (same for if you chose edge of bed)

If you chose edge of bed and pulled yourself out of basement you miss iut on having an accomplice.

First floor:
